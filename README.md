# ubiquity-misc

This repository constains files used by the Ubiquity team
that have no other obvious place to be put.  For now,
this repository contains all othe documentation and shell
files used to the Ubiqutiy/Ubuntu/ROS Kernel image.

If you read this documentation and it does not work for
you, please do the following:

1. Make a clone of this repository on you local desktop/laptop.

        cd /tmp           # Or someplace else of your choosing
        git clone https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/ubiquity-misc.git
        cd ubiqutiy-misc

2. Edit this file (`README.md`) using your favorite editor.
   Insert you comments and/or questions directly into the file
   using the following format:

        > * ....
        > ....
        > .... -- {your_name} *

   By way of explanation, lines start with `>` are indented
   by the markdown processor.  The `*` causes the text to be
   italicized.

3. Stuff the question(s) back up to the repository:

        git add README.md
        git commit -m "Added some questions/comments."
        git push

## Ubiquity/Ubuntu/ROS Kernel Image

The Ubuquity/Ubuntu/ROS Kernel Image is a Ubuntu 14.04LTS
Kernel for the ARM7 hard float architecture.  This image
has many Ubuntu and ROS packages preinstalled along with
a ROS catkin workspace.  The primary purpose of this image
is to ensure that all of the Ubiquity robot platforms start
from a common software base.

This kernel image only works for Ubuntu 14.04LTS
(i.e. "Trusty").

### Download and Installing the Ubiquity/Ubuntu/ROS Kernal Image

The most common way of install the image is to download
the image and copy it onto a micro-SD card.  THe micro-SD
card is plugged into a Raspberry Pi 2 and the Raspberry Pi 2
is powered up.  Please do the following steps:

1. Get a micro-SD card that is at least 4GB is size.  Frankly,
   we recommend a minimum of 16GB.

2. Get either a USB/micro-SD adapter or regular SD to micro-SD
   card adaptor and plug your micro-SD card into it.

3. On your laptop/desktop, run the following command on your
   Ubuntu 14.04LTS kernel from the command line:

        sudo blkid

   This will print a bunch of stuff out.

4. Insert your micro-SD adapter into your desktop and run
   the same command again:

        sudo blkid

   Again, this will print a bunch of stuff out.

5. For the `bmaptool copy` command further below, we are going
   to need to type in the correct location to copy the
   Ubiquity/Unbuntu/ROS kernel to.  This will have a form
   of `/dev/XXXX`, where `XXXX` depends upon your system.

   Now look through the two lists and visually search for the
   new entries from the first and second invocations of `blkid`.

   If see a one or two new lines show up that look like:

        /dev/sdX#: UUID="..." TYPE="..."

   The `X` will be a lower case letter (typically `a` or `b`)
   and the `#` will be a digit like `0` or `1`.
   The `/dev/XXXX` for the `bmaptool copy ...` command will be
   `/dev/sdX` where `X` is the lower case letter.

   Alternatively, if you see one or two lines that look like:

        /dev/mmcblk@p# UUID="..." TYPE="..."

   where both `@` and `#` are digits like `0` or `1`.
   The `/dev/XXX` for the `bmaptool copy ...` will be `/dev/mmcblk@`
   (i.e. no `p#`.)

   Write down the /dev/XXXX value we have just determined, we are
   going to need it later.

6. Download the image using the following commands:

        cd /tmp	       # Or someplace else if you choose...
        wget http://kchristo.homeip.net/files/rpi2_kernel.zip
        # This takes a while, it is ~570MB.

7. Unpacking the zip file below should result in a *.img and *.bmap file.

        unzip *.zip

8. Copy the .img file onto the micro-SD card.  This is the
   place where you will type in the value for `/dev/XXXX`
   that was determined in step 5 above.  Run the following
   commands (Remember to replace `/dev/XXXX`.):

        sudo apt-get install -y bmap-tools
        sudo bmaptool copy --bmap *.bmap *.img /dev/XXXX
	sudo rsynch

9. Remove the micro-SD card from the adaptor and plug it into
   Raspberry Pi 2 micor-SD slot.  This slot is on the *back*
   of the Raspberry Pi 2.

10. A RJ45 Ethernet cable between your Raspberry Pi 2 and
    your router.

11. Apply power to the Raspberry Pi 2 via the micro-USB
    connector on the edge of the the Raspberry Pi 2.

12. Wait about a minute.  The LED's on the Raspberry Pi 2
    should stop blinking.

13. Connect to the Raspberry Pi 2 from your laptop desktop:
        ssh ubuntu@ubuntu.local
        # If you asked a yes/no questions, answer `yes`.
        # Password is `ubuntu`
        # You should see a prompt that looks like:
        ubuntu@ubuntu:~$

14. Expand the 2nd partion to the full size of the micro-SD card:

        sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
        # Delete 2nd partition with (d,2)
        # Recreate 2nd partition with (n,p,2,enter,enter)
        # Write the new 2nd partition out (w)
        #
        # Now immediately reboot:
        sudo reboot

15. Login again and resize the file system:

        # From you deskop/laptop:
        ssh ubuntu@ubuntu.local
        sudo resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2

16. Install a swap file:

        sudo apt-get install dphys-swapfile

17. Make sure that you have the linux-firmware (should be already done).

        sudo apt-get install linux-firmware

18. Now is a good time to update your system:

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get upgrade

19. Make sure the file `/etc/modules-load.d/raspi-camera.conf`:

        # This command is no longer needed; it has already been done
        # with the standard image.
        sudo sh -c 'echo "bcm2835-v4l2 gst_v4l2src_is_broken=1" > /etc/modules-load.d/raspi-camera.conf'

20. Create a catkin workspace:

        cd ~
        mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
        cd catkin_ws
        catkin_make

21. Add `~/devel/setup.bash` to the end of `~/.bashrc`:

        echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
        source ~/.bashrc

## Software Needed for UR Code

This is a list of activities that are generally used after 
a new kernel is placed on a flash card for use.

* Simple checklist for setup on fresh kernel image

  Unzip and load to disk via Win32DiskImager on win7 or use linux
  Expand filesystem to use most of the 16Gb flash
  Change hostname in /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts.  
  Install r8188eu driver for TP-LINK WiFi 
  Edit /etc/network/interfaces to add wlan0 WiFi
  Form catkin_ws (see CatkinWs:)

* Software that comes in handy:

        sudo apt-get install wpasupplicant 
        sudo apt-get install minicom
        sudo apt-get install setserial
        sudo apt-get install mgetty
        sudo apt-get install wireless-tools
        sudo apt-get install --reinstall build-essential git

* Install your favoriate editor:

        sudo apt-get install vim     # For you vi folks
        sudo apt-get install emacs   # For you emacs folks

* Packages needed to make Ubiquity Robotics Packages:

        sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ros-tutorials            
        sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-joystick-drivers
        sudo apt-get install python-serial              
        sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-serial
        sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-navigation
        sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-tf-conversions
        sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-robot-model  
        sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-tf2-geometry-msgs

        cd ~/catkin_ws/src # to pull code that will be compiled
        git clone https://github.com/DLu/navigation_layers.git
        git clone https://github.com/ros/robot_state_publisher.git
        git clone https://github.com/bosch-ros-pkg/usb_cam.git

* Ubiquity Robotics Packages:

        #git clone https://github.com/hbrobotics/ros_arduino_bridge.git
        git clone https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/ros_arduino_bridge.git
        git clone https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/joystick_input.git
        git clone https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/fiducials.git

Warning: It will take a few passes of catkin_make to compile this as
it is likely you will run out of memory if made in one pass

### Constructing the Kernel Image from Scratch

This Ubiquity/ROS/Ubuntu Kernel image is constructed with
two scripts:

* `rpi2-build-image.sh` which does most of the building,  and

* `cleanup.sh` does the wrap-up work.

It should be possible to run these scripts on a either
Ubuntu 14.04LTS kernel running 64-bit x86 architecture
or on a Raspberry Pi 2 (hereafter shortened to RasPi2.)

This shell script is run as follows:

        sudo rm -rf /srv
        cd {directory that contains rpi2-build-image.sh}
        sudo ./rpi2-build-image.sh

> * When running rpi2-build-image.sh on an intel computer, if I use the
> script as it stands, Very quickly get a failure in the script at the 
> beginning .  I get the error
>
> "Couldn't download dists/trusty/main/binary-amd64/Packages" that were 
>   clearly not amd64 packages (i.e. raspberrypi-bootloader, etc.)
> 
> I also ran the script pointing to a local mirror.  In that case, 
> I received an error that those particular files could not be authenticated.  
> The apt-get in the script at line ~103 used the "-y" parameter without the 
> "--force-yes" parameter so the script failed.  I ended up editing that line
> to force the yes and the script ran fine.  I would note that ubuntu 
> documentation states using "--force-yes" is somewhat dangerous.
> -- {Kurt} *


As of now, this script fails when it trys to unmount
`/srv/rpi2/trusty/build/chroot/proc`.  The work around
is to reboot the machine:

        sudo reboot

Now finish everything off by running the remainder of the
script that is now sitting in `.../cleanup.sh`.

        sudo cleanup.sh

The result show up in `/srv/rpi2/trusty/` as two files
with suffixes that end in `.img` and `.bmap`.  There
are two things that can be done:

* The files can be compressed into a `.zip` file and put
  on a internet so that other people can download and
  install the image onto a micro-SD card.  Here is the
  command that does it:

        zip rpi2_kernel.zip *.img *.bmap

  The resulting `rpi2_kernel.zip` file can be put up on
  a server.  Please feel free to change `rpi_kernel` to
  something with a bit more information.

* The files can be copied directly onto a micro-SD card
  using the bmap-tools listed above:

        sudo apt-get install -y bmap-tools
        sudo bmaptool copy --bmap *.bmap *.img /dev/XXXX

  where XXXX is the appropriate raw device name for the
  micro-SD card.

## `gscam` Notes

> It looks like gscam is already being built and installed
> into the kernel image.
> -Wayne

The following commands build gscam:


        sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2 gst_v4l2src_is_broken=1
        sudo apt-get build-essential g++
        cd ~
        mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
        cd catkin_ws
        catkin_make
        source devel/setup.bash
        cd src
        git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/gscam.git
        rosdep update
        sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-image-common
        catkin_make
        roslaunch fiduicals_lib gscam.launch
        rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/image_raw

## WiFi Networking Issues

The problem is linux saves hard lan and wifi dongle macs and keeps
adding devices so you end up with say `eth2` but your
`/etc/network/interfaces` only has entry for `eth0`.

Here are some notes for sorting this out.  Tthe last half of this
set of cheet-sheet notes.


[Linux Network Specific]( https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/network-configuration.html)

* `ifconfig   [eth0]`:
  Shows network interface(s) that have been configured or
  maybe partly configured (like WiFi that cannot find network)

* `sudo ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.100 netmask 255.255.255.0` :
  You can temp configure one till reboot.

* `/etc/hostname`:
  This is where system hostname is defined on reboot.
  Also edit `/etc/hosts` if you do change host name!

* `/etc/network/interfaces`:
  Entries tie hardware like `eth0` and `wlan0` to be of a specific
  network port type. KEY file, see other places in doc.

* `/etc/resolv.conf`:
  Holds DNS resolutions (ip addresses).  Best to use tool to do this
  `dmesg | grep eth` Can show if eth0 or wlan0 was re-named due to
  new flash image.  Come up with no net and edit `/etc/network/interfaces`

* `/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules`:
  Edit this if you have left over `eth0` or `wlan0` from prior image
  so you get nice clean `eth0` and `wlan0`.
  This file has mac address to names like `wlan0`, `wlan1` and `eth0`
  and so on. Clean it out to have fresh discovery.

* `sudo ifup eth0`:
  Manually enable newly added interface from recent
  `/etc/network/interfaces`.  Can also use `sudo ifdown eth0`.

Sorting out linux images on ubuntu when networks get added:

* Boot up with hdmi monitor and usb keyboard usually (if no
  network no ssh ability)

* `sudo vi /etc/hosts` and `/etc/hostname` and set correct hostname
  for your system.

* `ifconfig` from here we want to see the eth0 and when wifi
  dongle is in `wlan0`.

* To hard-reset things, `sudo vi /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules`

  1. Remove all the lines below top 2 lines of general comments as it
     is here that you may find your ethernet was nammed `eth2` or
     something and `/etc/network/interfaces` does not match so you
     get no network

  2. `sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces` and have just the use of `eth0`
     and `wlan0`, NOT higher numbers.

* Reboot and again on hdmi monitor.  Do `ifconfig` and hopefully
  you have `eth0` now and if you had wifi and config in
  `/etc/network/interfaces` for `wlan0` you also have wifi now

## Bring 8188 WiFi Dongle Notes:

WiFi with Kurts Kernel working for me today.

One tiny change from your modprobe so when I was in 
/lib/modules/3.18.0-24-rpi2 I used like you did and saw 
he .ko so did this:

        ln -s kernel/drivers/staging/rtl8188eu/rtl8188eu.ko

Difference was I had to then use :

        modprobe r8188eu
        # you had said modprobe rtl8188eu which does not work for me.

After above you should be able to see

        iwconfig  show wlan0

but it will still say unassociated because `/etc/network/interfaces`
not set yet so I then put these EXACT lines at END of
`/etc/network/interfaces` right from Kurt.

        # WiFi dongle
        allow-hotplug wlan0
        auto wlan0
        iface wlan0 inet dhcp
          wpa-ssid "2WIRE270"
          wpa-psk  "d4c33208f8fdc ... from wpa_passphrase 5aa32"

After reboot you should NOT see `iwconfig` showing unassociated
or similar word right after it says `wlan0`:

Also, I do NOT see `/dev/wlan0` (I too am puzzled??)
but with lsmod I see this line matching my modprobe argument:

        r8188eu               408198  0


`lsusb` gives me this:

        Bus 001 Device 004: ID 0bda:8179 Realtek Semiconductor Corp.
